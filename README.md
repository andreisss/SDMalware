There are many tools available for malware analysis, and different analysts use different combinations of tools depending on their needs and preferences. However, one possible toolchain for malware analysis that incorporates both static and dynamic analysis could include the following components:

Capa: A static analysis tool that uses rules to identify capabilities within a malware sample. Capa can help identify the behavior of the malware and its potential impact on a system.

Speakeasy: A dynamic analysis tool that allows for the execution of a malware sample in a controlled environment to observe its behavior. Speakeasy can help identify the malware's network communication, file system modifications, and other behavior.

PE file analysis tools: There are various tools available for analyzing the structure and content of Portable Executable (PE) files, which are used in Windows executables. These tools can help identify the functions, libraries, and dependencies used by the malware, as well as any suspicious or obfuscated code.
